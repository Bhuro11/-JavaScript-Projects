                    The <b>Hewlett-Packard</b> Company, commonly shortened to Hewlett-Packard or HP, was an American
                    multinational information technology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California. HP developed
                    and provided a wide variety of hardware components, as well as software and related services to
                    consumers, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and large enterprises, including customers in
                    the government, health, and education sectors. The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo
                    Alto by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in 1939, and initially produced a line of electronic test and
                    measurement equipment. The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California
                    Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling it the "Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'". In
                    1999, HP spun off its electronic and bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business into
                    Agilent Technologies; HP retained focus on its later products, including computers and printers. It
                    merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired Electronic Data Systems in 2008, which led to combined
                    revenues of $118.4 billion that year and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP
                    announced its acquisition of 3Com, and closed the deal on April 12, 2010. On April 28, 2010, HP
                    announced its buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion. On September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war
                    for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion), which Dell declined to match.
